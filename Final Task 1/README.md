## Final Lab Task 1 - Events Management DB ##

Using MySQL workbench, we first create a database umder the name events_db. After that create a events_tbl : this table consist the events_id as the PRIMARY Key and event_name.


## Step 2: Create attendees_tbl ##

This table will hold the attendees_id as the PRIMARY Key and also the attendees_name.

## Step 3: Create events_attendees_tbl ##

This table will links the events_tbl and attendees_tbl using a many-to-many relationship. 

It uses event_id and attendees_id as FOREIGN Keys.
